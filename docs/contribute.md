# How to contribute?
ThreeMap is in dire need of contributors. Aspects that
`require(most attention)` :smile: are
* Performance - even if ThreeMap uses WebWorkers it's still not enough
* New features & improvements - for example points implementation & roads cups & joins

ThreeMap is written in Typescript. If you don't know this language then checkout
[this guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).
If you don't want to use this and still want to contribute then
in your issues write code in JS and I'll try to port it to TS.

For better understanding of code, explore [API](api-readme.md).
